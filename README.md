# Star Formation : Bousso and Leichenauer Model

### These are the files and Matheamtica code for the Bousso and Leichenauer Model of Star formation in the Multiverse. This is a project I did at the University of Geneva in the summer of 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Lucas Lombriser and Dr. Daniele Sorini. My main project involved  comparing different Star formation models and compare their Star formation rate density (SFRDs) in the multiverse that is comparing these models both in our universe or the Standard Cosmology as well as observing how the models change with respect to each other for different Universes / Cosmology. I was mainly working on two models namely the Bousso and Leichenauer (2008) Model of Star formation : https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3044v1 and the Sorini - Peacock (2021) Model of Star formation : https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01146, along with these I have also studied about the Hernquist-Springel formalism for cosmic star formation . In this project I am also working closely with Dr. Daniele Sorini , Post-Doctoral Fellow working with Prof. John Peacock, FRS, FRSE at the Institute for Astronomy , The University of Edinburgh who are also part of this project. I have recently given a talk on my work titled "Star Formation in the Multiverse" as part of this project, The link of the talk : https://youtu.be/NtZF6Fjfqio
